You can't just fire up python and check things, django doesn't know what project you want to work on.

You have to do one of these things:
    Use python manage.py shell
    Use django-admin.py shell --settings=mysite.settings (or whatever settings module you use)
    setup_environ(settings)


To Run Server:
    $python manage.py runserver

To Run Tests:
    $python manage.py test <application>

Admin...
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/



Now Django knows to include the polls app. Letâ€™s run another command:

$ python manage.py makemigrations polls

Does the migrations...
$python manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001

Now, run migrate again to create those model tables in your database:

$ python manage.py migrate


Migrations are very powerful and let you change your models over time,
 as you develop your project, without the need to delete your database or tables and make new ones -
 it specializes in upgrading your database live, without losing data.

Change your models (in models.py).
python manage.py makemigrations   --  to create migrations for those change
python manage.py migrate  --- to apply those changes to the database.
